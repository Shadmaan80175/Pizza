Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of a Domino's Pizza sales dataset to uncover key business insights and performance metrics. The goal was to translate raw sales data into an interactive dashboard (represented in this PDF) that highlights sales trends, customer ordering behavior, and product performance. This analysis aids in strategic decision-making for inventory management, marketing, and menu optimization.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks several high-level KPIs that provide a snapshot of overall business health:

• Total Revenue: $873,803.20

• Average Order Value: $40.93

• Total Pizzas Sold: 52,979

• Total Orders: 21,350

• Average Pizzas Per Order: 2.48

Tools & Methods
• Data Analysis & Processing: Likely performed using SQL for data extraction and aggregation, or Excel/Power Query for data cleaning and transformation.

• Data Visualization: The final dashboard was created using a BI tool like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker Studio to create interactive charts and graphs.

• Business Intelligence: The project follows a standard BI workflow: Data Sourcing -> Cleaning -> Analysis -> Visualization -> Insight Generation.

Key Insights & Analysis
1. Sales & Order Trends

• Peak Business Days: Orders are highest on Fridays and Saturdays, indicating strong weekend demand. Evenings are the busiest time.

• Seasonal Trends: The months of May and July show the highest number of orders, suggesting potential seasonal promotions or factors influencing demand.

2. Product Performance

• Top Category: The "Classic" pizza category is the highest contributor to both total sales and total orders.

• Preferred Size: Large-sized pizzas generate the maximum revenue, aligning with the high average number of pizzas per order (2.48).

3. Best & Worst Sellers

• Revenue Champion: The Thai Chicken Pizza is the top-performing pizza in terms of revenue generation.

• Quantity & Orders Champion: The Classic Deluxe Pizza is the most frequently ordered pizza, leading in both total quantity sold and total number of orders.

• Consistent Underperformer: The Brie Carre Pizza is the poorest performer across all key metrics: revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.

Business Implications & Recommendations
Based on the insights from this dashboard, the following strategic actions can be recommended:

• Inventory & Supply Chain: Focus inventory planning for "Classic" category ingredients and large-size pizza bases, especially on weekends and during May/July.

• Marketing & Promotions:

Create featured deals or "Meal of the Day" offers around top-selling pizzas like the Thai Chicken and Classic Deluxe.

Consider bundling or discounting low-performing pizzas (like the Brie Carre) to clear inventory or introduce them to a wider audience.

• Menu Optimization:

Highlight best-selling pizzas on the menu and in promotional materials.

Evaluate whether the worst-performing pizzas should be retained, re-branded, or removed from the menu to simplify operations.

• Staffing: Schedule more staff during weekend evenings and the peak summer months (May, July) to handle the increased order volume efficiently.
